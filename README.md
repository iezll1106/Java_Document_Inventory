# Overview Java_Document_Inventory

In Module 03, I chose to work with Java programming. I developed a console-based Java application that allows users to manage document records, including details such as ID, name, type, date created, office, and image path (for scanned copies). The system supports core functionalities like adding, listing, filtering, editing, and deleting records.

The purpose of creating this software was to demonstrate my foundational skills in Java programmingâ€”ranging from setting up the development environment (JDK and relevant packages) to writing structured, functional code for a real-world application scenario.
